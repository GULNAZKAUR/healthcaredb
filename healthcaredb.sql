The hope is that the group, funded with a subsidy of Â£1m, will lead to long term research into skin diseases, and the discovery of new treatments for conditions such as acne. Professor van Steensel is an internationally renowned expert in genetic skin disorders. Whilst the causes of acne to date are largely unknown, Professor van Steensel has evidence that the cause of moderate to severe acne could be in the genes. â€œBased on recent work we have radically new insights into the pathogenesis of acne. We are using those to build a high-content phenotypic screen, which can identify novel drugs to treat this very common skin disease.â€ He went on to say, â€œAs well as trying to find new treatments for acne through scientific research, we want to better understand the patient journey.

It is especially problematic to establish the limits of depressive disorder in young people because of the cognitive and physical changes that take place during this time. Adolescents tend to feel things particularly deeply and marked mood swings are common during the teens. It can be difficult to distinguish these intense emotional reactions from depressive disorders. By contrast, young adolescents do not find it easy to describe how they are feeling and often confuse emotions such as anger and sadness. They have particular difficulty describing certain of the key cognitive symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness and self-denigration. Assessment of young people who present with symptoms of depression must, therefore, begin with the basic question of diagnosis. This will mean interviewing the adolescent alone. It is not enough to rely on accounts obtained ', '2018-05-11 01:22:22', 14),

The roots of your teeth have thousands of tiny tubes that carry feeling (hot, cold, sweet) to a nerve center known as the pulp. Usually the roots are covered by gum tissue. But if you have periodontal disease, that layer can pull away from teeth, exposing the ultra-sensitive root. Receding gums need a dentist\'s help, so talk to yours. If you brush too hard or don\'t use a soft brush, your gums can pull away from tooth roots. This can also wear away your enamel and expose dentin (yellow). Holes in the dentin are the tiny tubes (blue) that allow hot, cold, and sweet foods to affect tooth nerves.

Once a tooth is cracked, the nerve-rich pulp hidden deep inside may become irritated when chewing. A crack may also fill with bacteria, leading to inflammation, which can cause more pain. Tooth enamel is the strongest material in your body, but it\'s no match for the power of clenching or grinding. Over time, both of these often-mindless habits can wear away enamel, leaving the nerves in danger. Mouth guards, lifestyle changes, and diet tweaks can all help stop the wear and tear. Decay, like this cavity, exposes the root of your tooth to a host of irritants: hot, cold, sweets, even air. The best ways to battle decay and keep your teeth in top form are to practice good oral hygiene, eat right, and see your dentist regularly.You don\'t have to go it alone -- talk to your dentist to find out what\'s behind your sensitive teeth.

(18, 'Absence seizures', 'upload/diseases/dis1.jpg', '            Many children appear to have a genetic predisposition to absence seizures. In general, seizures are caused by abnormal electrical impulses from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain\'s nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain\'s usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern.People who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters).', '            Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They\'re more common in children than in adults.Someone having an absence seizure may look like he or she is staring blankly into space for a few seconds. Then, there is a quick return to a normal level of alertness. This type of seizure usually doesn\'t lead to physical injury. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medications. Some children who have them also develop other seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.', '              An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include: Sudden stop in motion without falling ,Lip smacking ,Eyelid flutters ,Chewing motions ,Finger rubbing ,Small movements of both hands.', '      Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include: Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern. Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation.'),
(19, 'Acne', 'upload/diseases/acne.jpg', 'Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It often causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples, and usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. Effective treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.', 'Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands. The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it\'s exposed to the air. Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation that develop deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren\'t usually involved in acne.', 'Acne signs and symptoms vary depending on the severity of your condition: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores), Blackheads (open plugged pores) ,Small red, tender bumps (papules) ,Pimples (pustules), which are papules with pus at their tips ,Large, solid, painful lumps beneath the surface of the skin (nodules) ,Painful, pus-filled lumps beneath the surface of the skin (cystic lesions).', 'Acne medications work by reducing oil production, speeding up skin cell turnover, fighting bacterial infection or reducing inflammation â€” which helps prevent scarring. With most prescription acne drugs, you may not see results for four to eight weeks, and your skin may get worse before it gets better. It can take many months or years for your acne to clear up completely. The treatment regimen your doctor recommends depends on your age, the type and severity of your acne, and what you are willing to commit to. For example, you may need to wash and apply medications to the affected skin twice a day for several weeks. Often topical medications and drugs you take by mouth (oral medication) are used in combination. Pregnant women will not be able to use oral prescription medications for acne. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of medications and other treatments you are considering.'),
(20, 'Acute kidney failure', 'upload/diseases/00.jpg', '  Acute kidney failure occurs when your kidneys suddenly become unable to filter waste products from your blood. When your kidneys lose their filtering ability, dangerous levels of wastes may accumulate, and your blood\'s chemical makeup may get out of balance. Acute kidney failure â€” also called acute renal failure or acute kidney injury â€” develops rapidly over a few hours or a few days. Acute kidney failure is most common in people who are already hospitalized, particularly in critically ill people who need intensive care. Acute kidney failure can be fatal and requires intensive treatment. However, acute kidney failure may be reversible. If you\'re otherwise in good health, you may recover normal or nearly normal kidney function.', '  Potential complications of acute kidney failure include: Fluid buildup:Acute kidney failure may lead to a buildup of fluid in your lungs, which can cause shortness of breath. Chest pain: If the lining that covers your heart (pericardium) becomes inflamed, you may experience chest pain.\r\nMuscle weakness: When your body\'s fluids and electrolytes â€” your body\'s blood chemistry â€” are out of balance, muscle weakness can result. Elevated levels of potassium in your blood are particularly dangerous. kidney damage: Occasionally, acute kidney failure causes permanent loss of kidney function, or end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease require either permanent dialysis â€” a mechanical filtration process used to remove toxins and wastes from the body â€” or a kidney transplant to survive. Death: Acute kidney failure can lead to loss of kidney function and, ultimately, death. The risk of death is higher in people who had kidney problems before acute kidney failure.', '  Signs and symptoms of acute kidney failure may include: Decreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normal ,Fluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feet ,Drowsiness ,Shortness of breath ,Fatigue ,Confusion ,Nausea ,Seizures or coma in severe cases ,Chest pain or \r\npressure.', '  If your signs and symptoms suggest that you have acute kidney failure, your doctor may recommend certain tests and procedures to verify your diagnosis. These may include: Urine output measurements: The amount of urine you excrete in a day may help your doctor determine the cause of your kidney failure. Urine tests: Analyzing a sample of your urine, a procedure called urinalysis, may reveal abnormalities that suggest kidney failure.\r\nBlood tests: A sample of your blood may reveal rapidly rising levels of urea and creatinine â€” two substances used to measure kidney function.\r\nImaging tests: Imaging tests such as ultrasound and computerized tomography may be used to help your doctor see your kidneys.\r\nRemoving a sample of kidney tissue for testing. In some situations, your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a small sample of kidney tissue for lab testing. Your doctor inserts a needle through your skin and into your kidney to remove the sample.'),
(21, 'Bedsores', 'upload/diseases/01.jpg', 'Bedsores â€” also called pressure ulcers and decubitus ulcers â€” are injuries to skin and underlying tissue resulting from prolonged pressure on the skin. Bedsores most often develop on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as the heels, ankles, hips and tailbone. People most at risk of bedsores are those with a medical condition that limits their ability to change positions or those who spend most of their time in a bed or chair. Bedsores can develop quickly. Most sores heal with treatment, but some never heal completely. You can take steps to help prevent bedsores and aid healing.', 'Bedsores are caused by pressure against the skin that limits blood flow to the skin. Other factors related to limited mobility can make the skin vulnerable to damage and contribute to the development of pressure sores. Three primary contributing factors for bedsores are: Pressure. Constant pressure on any part of your body can lessen the blood flow to tissues. Blood flow is essential to delivering oxygen and other nutrients to tissues. Without these essential nutrients, skin and nearby tissues are damaged and might eventually die. For people with limited mobility, this kind of pressure tends to happen in areas that aren\'t well-padded with muscle or fat and that lie over a bone, such as the spine, tailbone, shoulder blades, hips, heels and elbows. Friction. Friction occurs when the skin rubs against clothing or bedding. It can make fragile skin more vulnerable to injury, especially if the skin is also moist. Shear. Shear occurs when two surfaces move in the opposite direction. For example, when a bed is elevated at the head, you can slide down in bed. As the tailbone moves down, the skin over the bone might stay in place â€” essentially pulling in the opposite direction.', 'Warning signs of pressure ulcers are: Unusual changes in skin color or texture ,Swelling ,Pus-like draining ,An area of skin that feels cooler or warmer to the touch than other areas ,Tender areas .Bedsores fall into one of several stages based on their depth, severity and other characteristics. The degree of skin and tissue damage ranges from red, unbroken skin to a deep injury involving muscle and bone.', 'Your doctor will look closely at your skin to determine whether you have a pressure ulcer and how bad the damage is. He or she will try to assign a stage to the wound. Staging helps determine what treatment is best for you. He or she might also order a blood test to assess your general health. Treating pressure ulcers involves reducing pressure on the affected skin, caring for the wounds, controlling pain, preventing infection and maintaining good nutrition. Treatment team. Addressing the many aspects of wound care usually requires a multidisciplinary approach. Members of your care team might include: A primary care physician who oversees the treatment plan , A physician or nurse specializing in wound care ,Nurses or medical assistants who provide both care and education for managing wounds ,A social worker who helps you or your family access resources and who addresses emotional concerns related to long-term recovery.'),
(22, 'Bladder cancer', 'upload/diseases/02.jpg', 'Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers, affecting approximately 68,000 adults in the United States each year. Bladder cancer occurs in men more frequently than it does in women and usually affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. Bladder cancer most often begins in the cells (urothelial cells) that line the inside of your bladder â€” the hollow, muscular organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Although it\'s most common in the bladder, this same type of cancer can occur in other parts of the urinary tract drainage system. About seven out of every 10 bladder cancers diagnosed start out at an early stage â€” when bladder cancer is highly treatable. However, even early-stage bladder cancer may recur in the bladder. For this reason, people with bladder cancer typically need follow-up tests for years after treatment to look for bladder cancer that recurs or advances to a higher stage.', 'Bladder cancer develops when cells in the bladder begin to grow abnormally. Rather than grow and divide in an orderly way, these cells develop mutations that cause them to grow out of control and not die. These abnormal cells form a tumor. Causes of bladder cancer include: Smoking and other tobacco use ,Exposure to chemicals, especially working in a job that requires exposure to chemicals ,Past radiation exposure ,Chronic irritation of the lining of the bladder.', 'Bladder cancer signs and symptoms may include: Blood in urine (hematuria) ,Painful urination ,Pelvic pain. If you have hematuria, your urine may appear bright red or cola colored. Sometimes, urine may not look any different, but blood in urine may be detected during a microscopic exam of the urine. People with bladder cancer might also experience: Back pain ,Frequent urination .But, these symptoms often occur because of something other than bladder cancer.', 'Although there\'s no guaranteed way to prevent bladder cancer, you can take steps to help reduce your risk. For instance: Don\'t smoke. Not smoking means that cancer-causing chemicals in smoke can\'t collect in your bladder. If you don\'t smoke, don\'t start. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about a plan to help you stop. Support groups, medications and other methods may help you quit. Take caution around chemicals. If you work with chemicals, follow all safety instructions to avoid exposure. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables. Choose a diet rich in a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may help reduce your risk of cancer.'),
(23, 'Bone spurs', 'upload/diseases/03.jpg', 'Bone spurs are bony projections that develop along bone edges. Bone spurs (osteophytes) often form where bones meet each other â€” in your joints. They can also form on the bones of your spine. The main cause of bone spurs is the joint damage associated with osteoarthritis. Most bone spurs cause no symptoms and can go undetected for years. They might not require treatment. If treatment is needed, it depends on where spurs are located and how they affect your health.', 'Joint damage from osteoarthritis is the most common cause of bone spurs. As osteoarthritis breaks down the cartilage cushioning the ends of your bones, your body attempts to repair the loss by creating bone spurs near the damaged area.', 'Most bone spurs cause no signs or symptoms. You might not realize you have bone spurs until an X-ray for another condition reveals the growths. In some cases, though, bone spurs can cause pain and loss of motion in your joints. Specific symptoms depend on where the bone spurs are. Examples include: Knee: Bone spurs in your knee can make it painful to extend and bend your leg. Spine: On your vertebrae, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains your spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots and can cause weakness or numbness in your arms or legs.\r\nHip: Bone spurs can make it painful to move your hip, although you might feel the pain in your knee. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in your hip joint.', 'During the physical exam, your doctor might feel around your joint to pinpoint your pain. Your doctor might also order X-rays or other imaging tests to view your joints and bones. If your bone spurs cause pain, your doctor might recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others)'),
(24, 'Cataracts', 'upload/diseases/04.jpg', 'A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is a bit like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car (especially at night) or see the expression on a friend\'s face. Most cataracts develop slowly and don\'t disturb your eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually interfere with your vision. At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help you deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision interferes with your usual activities, you might need cataract surgery. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.', 'Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye\'s lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye (iris). The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina â€” the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes', 'Signs and symptoms of cataracts include: Clouded, blurred or dim vision ,Increasing difficulty with vision at night ,Sensitivity to light and glare ,Need for brighter light for reading and other activities ,Seeing \"halos\" around lights ,Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription ,Fading or yellowing of colors ,Double vision in a single eye.', 'To determine whether you have a cataract, your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms, and perform an eye examination. Your doctor may conduct several tests, including: Visual acuity test: A visual acuity test uses an eye chart to measure how well you can read a series of letters. Your eyes are tested one at a time, while the other eye is covered. Using a chart or a viewing device with progressively smaller letters, your eye doctor determines if you have 20/20 vision or if your vision shows signs of impairment. Slit-lamp examination. A slit lamp allows your eye doctor to see the structures at the front of your eye under magnification. The microscope is called a slit lamp because it uses an intense line of light, a slit, to illuminate your cornea, iris, lens, and the space between your iris and cornea. The slit allows your doctor to view these structures in small sections, which makes it easier to detect any tiny abnormalities. Retinal exam:To prepare for a retinal exam, your eye doctor puts drops in your eyes to open your pupils wide (dilate). This makes it easier to examine the back of your eyes (retina). Using a slit lamp or a special device called an ophthalmoscope, your eye doctor can examine your lens for signs of a cataract.'),
(25, 'Celiac disease', 'upload/diseases/05.jpg', 'Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), sometimes called sprue or coeliac, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine\'s lining and prevents absorption of some nutrients (malabsorption). The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia, and can lead to serious complications. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development, in addition to the symptoms seen in adults.', 'Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin disease that stems from intestinal gluten intolerance. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks. Dermatitis herpetiformis is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the disease may not produce noticeable digestive symptoms. Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash.', 'The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and are different in children and adults. The most common signs for adults are diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss. Adults may also experience bloating and gas, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. However, more than half of adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: Anemia, usually resulting from iron deficiency ,Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia) ,Itchy, blistery skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis) ,Damage to dental enamel ,Mouth ulcers.', 'Researchers estimate that only 20 percent of people with celiac disease may receive a diagnosis. Doctors may order two blood tests to help diagnose celiac disease. Serology testing looks for antibodies in your blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten.\r\nGenetic testing for human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) can be used to rule out celiac disease. If the results of these tests indicate celiac disease, your doctor may order an endoscopy to view your small intestine and to take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to analyze for damage to the villi. It\'s important to be tested for celiac disease before trying a gluten-free diet. Eliminating gluten from your diet may change the results of blood tests so that they appear to be normal.'),
(26, 'Cerebral palsy', 'upload/diseases/06.jpg', 'Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture that is caused by damage that occurs to the immature, developing brain, most often before birth. Signs and symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years. In general, cerebral palsy causes impaired movement associated with abnormal reflexes, floppiness or rigidity of the limbs and trunk, abnormal posture, involuntary movements, unsteady walking, or some combination of these. People with cerebral palsy may have problems swallowing and commonly have eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don\'t focus on the same object. People with cerebral palsy also may suffer reduced range of motion at various joints of their bodies due to muscle stiffness. Cerebral palsy\'s effect on functional abilities varies greatly. Some affected people can walk while others can\'t. Some people show normal or near-normal intellectual capacity, but others may have intellectual disabilities. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also may be present.', 'Cerebral palsy is caused by an abnormality or disruption in brain development, usually before a child is born. In many cases, the exact trigger isn\'t known. Factors that may lead to problems with brain development include: Mutations in genes that lead to abnormal brain development ,Maternal infections that affect the developing fetus ,Fetal stroke, a disruption of blood supply to the developing brain ,Infant infections that cause inflammation in or around the brain ,Traumatic head injury to an infant from a motor vehicle accident or fall ,Lack of oxygen to the brain (asphyxia) related to difficult labor or delivery, although birth-related asphyxia is much less commonly a cause than historically thought.', 'Signs and symptoms can vary greatly. Movement and coordination problems associated with cerebral palsy may include: Variations in muscle tone, such as being either too stiff or too floppy ,Stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity) ,Stiff muscles with normal reflexes (rigidity) ,Lack of muscle coordination (ataxia) ,Tremors or involuntary movements ,Slow, writhing movements (athetosis) ,Delays in reaching motor skills milestones, such as pushing up on arms, sitting up alone or crawling,Favoring one side of the body, such as reaching with only one hand or dragging a leg while crawling.', 'If your family doctor or pediatrician suspects your child has cerebral palsy, he or she will evaluate your child\'s signs and symptoms, review your child\'s medical history, and conduct a physical evaluation. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist trained in treating children with brain and nervous system conditions (pediatric neurologist). Your doctor will also order a series of tests to make a diagnosis and rule out other possible causes.'),

Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash, include: Fever , Loss of appetite, Headache,Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise. New bumps continue to appear for several days. As a result, you may have all three stages of the rash â€” bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions â€” at the same time on the second day of the rash. Once infected, you can spread the virus for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and you remain contagious until all spots crust over. The disease is generally mild in healthy children. In severe cases, the rash can spread to cover the entire body, and lesions may form in the throat, eyes and mucous membranes of the urethra, anus and vagina. New spots continue to appear for several days.', 'Doctors generally diagnose chickenpox based on the telltale rash. If there\'s any doubt about the diagnosis, chickenpox can be confirmed with laboratory tests, including blood tests or a culture of lesion samples.

Ewing sarcoma is more common in teenagers and young adults, but it can occur at any age', 'Ewing sarcoma can spread from where it started to other areas, making treatment and recovery more difficult. For example, the cancer can spread to other tissues, bone marrow, other bones or to the lungs. Ewing sarcoma can also return after treatment. As with other types of serious cancer, aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for Ewing sarcoma can cause substantial side effects, both in the short and long term. The health care team takes steps to treat and manage these effects as best as possible. And it\'s important for you to learn what to watch for and contact your team with any concerns.', 'Signs and symptoms of Ewing sarcoma include: Pain, swelling or tenderness near the affected area ,Bone pain, which may worsen at night or with physical activity ,Unexplained tiredness ,Fever with no known cause ,Unintended weight loss ,Broken bone with no known cause.', 'Typically, signs and symptoms lead parents to seek medical help for their child. Sometimes Ewing sarcoma is ultimately found when a child is brought in for treatment for what\'s thought to be a sprain or some other type of sports injury. Usually an X-ray shows a suspicious area. Then the doctor recommends one or more additional imaging tests to evaluate the area, such as: Computerized tomography (CT) ,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ,Positron emission tomography (PET) ,Bone scan.'),
(32, 'Eye floaters', 'upload/diseases/13.jpg', 'Eye floaters are spots in your vision. They may look to you like black or gray specks, strings, or cobwebs that drift about when you move your eyes and appear to dart away when you try to look at them directly. Most eye floaters are caused by age-related changes that occur as the jelly-like substance (vitreous) inside your eyes becomes more liquid. Microscopic fibers within the vitreous tend to clump and can cast tiny shadows on your retina. The shadows you see are called floaters. If you notice a sudden increase in eye floaters, contact an eye specialist immediately â€” especially if you also see light flashes or lose your peripheral vision. These can be symptoms of an emergency that requires prompt attention.', 'Eye floaters may be caused by the normal aging process or as a result from other diseases or conditions: Age-related eye changes. As you age, the vitreous, or jelly-like substance filling your eyeballs and helping them to maintain their round shape, changes. Over time, the vitreous partially liquefies â€” a process that causes it to pull away from the eyeball\'s interior surface. As the vitreous shrinks and sags, it clumps and gets stringy. This debris blocks some of the light passing through the eye, casting tiny shadows on your retina that are seen as floaters. Inflammation in the back of the eye. Posterior uveitis is inflammation in the layers of the uvea in the back of the eye. This condition can cause the release of inflammatory debris into the vitreous that are seen as floaters. Posterior uveitis may be caused by infection, inflammatory diseases or other causes. Bleeding in the eye. Bleeding into the vitreous can have many causes, including diabetes, hypertension, blocked blood vessels and injury. Blood cells are seen as floaters.', 'Symptoms of eye floaters may include: Small shapes in your vision that appear as dark specks or knobby, transparent strings of floating material ,Spots that move when you move your eyes, so when you try to look at them, they move quickly out of your visual field ,Spots that are most noticeable when you look at a plain bright background, such as a blue sky or a white wall ,Small shapes or strings that eventually settle down and drift out of the line of vision.', 'Any underlying cause of the floaters, such as bleeding from diabetes or inflammation, will be treated. However, most eye floaters don\'t require treatment. Eye floaters can be frustrating, and adjusting to them can take time. Once you know the floaters will not cause any more problems, you may eventually be able to ignore them or notice them less often. If your eye floaters impair your vision, which happens rarely, you and your eye doctor may consider treatment. Options may include: Surgery to remove the vitreous. An ophthalmologist removes the vitreous through a small incision (vitrectomy) and replaces it with a solution to help your eye maintain its shape. Surgery may not remove all the floaters, and new floaters can develop after surgery. Risks of a vitrectomy include bleeding and retinal tears. Using a laser to disrupt the floaters. An ophthalmologist aims a special laser at the floaters in the vitreous, which may break them up and make them less noticeable. Some people who have this treatment report improved vision; others notice little or no difference. Risks of laser therapy include damage to your retina if the laser is aimed incorrectly. Laser surgery to treat floaters is used infrequently.'),
(33, 'Eye melanoma', 'upload/diseases/25.jpg', 'Melanoma is a type of cancer that develops in the cells that produce melanin â€” the pigment that gives your skin its color. Your eyes also have melanin-producing cells and can develop melanoma. Eye melanoma is also called ocular melanoma. Most eye melanomas form in the part of the eye you can\'t see when looking in a mirror. This makes eye melanoma difficult to detect. In addition, eye melanoma typically doesn\'t cause early signs or symptoms.\r\nTreatment is available for eye melanomas. Treatment for some small eye melanomas may not interfere with your vision. However, treatment for large eye melanomas typically causes some vision loss.', 'Eye melanoma most commonly develops in the cells of the uvea, the vascular layer of your eye sandwiched between the retina, the thin layer of tissue that lines the back inner wall of your eyeball, and the white of your eye (sclera). Eye melanoma can occur in the front part of the uvea (iris and ciliary body) or in the back part of the uvea (choroid layer). Eye melanoma can also occur on the outermost layer on the front of the eye (conjunctiva), in the socket that surrounds the eyeball and on the eyelid, though these types of eye melanoma are very rare.', 'Eye melanoma may not cause signs and symptoms. When they do occur, signs and symptoms of eye melanoma can include: A growing dark spot on the iris ,A sensation of flashing lights ,A change in the shape of the dark circle (pupil) at the center of your eye ,Poor or blurry vision in one eye ,Loss of peripheral vision ,Sensation of flashes and specks of dust in your vision (floaters).', 'To diagnose eye melanoma, your doctor may recommend: Eye exam. Your doctor will examine the outside of your eye, looking for enlarged blood vessels that can indicate a tumor inside your eye. Then, with the help of instruments, your doctor will look inside your eye. One method, called ophthalmoscopy, uses lenses and a bright light mounted on your doctor\'s forehead â€” a bit like a miner\'s lamp. Another method, called slit-lamp biomicroscopy, uses a microscope that produces an intense beam of light to illuminate the interior of your eye. Eye ultrasound. An eye ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves from a hand-held, wand-like apparatus called a transducer to produce images of your eye. The transducer is placed on your closed eyelid or on the front surface of your eye .Imaging of the blood vessels in and around the tumor (angiogram). During an angiogram of your eye, a colored dye is injected into a vein in your arm. The dye travels to the blood vessels in your eye. A camera with special filters to detect the dye takes flash pictures every few seconds for several minutes.'),
(34, 'Farsightedness', 'upload/diseases/26.jpg', 'Farsightedness (hyperopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see distant objects clearly, but objects nearby may be blurry. The degree of your farsightedness influences your focusing ability. People with severe farsightedness may see clearly only objects a great distance away, while those with mild farsightedness may be able to clearly see objects that are closer. Farsightedness usually is present at birth and tends to run in families. You can easily correct this condition with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Another treatment option is surgery', 'Your eye has two parts that focus images: The cornea, the clear front surface of your eye ,The lens, a clear structure inside your eye that changes shape to help focus on objects ,In a perfectly shaped eye, each of these focusing elements has a perfectly smooth curvature, like the surface of a marble. A cornea and lens with such curvature bend (refract) all incoming light to make a sharply focused image directly on the retina, at the back of your eye.', 'Farsightedness may mean: Nearby objects may appear blurry ,You need to squint to see clearly ,You have eyestrain, including burning eyes, and aching in or around the eyes ,You experience general eye discomfort or a headache after a prolonged interval of conducting close tasks, such as reading, writing, computer work or drawing.', 'Farsightedness is diagnosed by a basic eye exam. A complete eye examination involves a series of tests. Your eye doctor may use odd-looking instruments, aim bright lights directly at your eyes and request that you look through an array of lenses. Each test allows your doctor to examine a different aspect of your eyes, including your vision. The goal of treating farsightedness is to help focus light on the retina through the use of corrective lenses or refractive surgery.'),

Fetal alcohol syndrome causes brain damage and growth problems. The problems caused by fetal alcohol syndrome vary from child to child, but defects caused by fetal alcohol syndrome are not reversible. There is no amount of alcohol that\'s known to be safe to consume during pregnancy. If you drink during pregnancy, you place your baby at risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. If you suspect your child has fetal alcohol syndrome, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis may help to reduce problems such as learning difficulties and behavioral issues.', 'If you\'re pregnant and can\'t stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help.Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child\'s doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don\'t wait for problems to arise before seeking help. If you have adopted a child or are providing foster care, you may not know if the biological mother drank alcohol while pregnant â€” and it may not initially occur to you that your child may have fetal alcohol syndrome. However, if your child has problems with learning and behavior, talk with his or her doctor so that the underlying cause might be identified.', 'The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies, with some children experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life. The more you drink while pregnant, the greater the risk to your unborn baby. However, any amount of alcohol puts your baby at risk. Your baby\'s brain, heart and blood vessels begin to develop in the early weeks of pregnancy, before you may know you\'re pregnant. Impairment of facial features, the heart and other organs, including the bones, and the central nervous system may occur as a result of drinking alcohol during the first trimester. That\'s when these parts of the fetus are in key stages of development. However, the risk is present at any time during pregnancy.', 'Diagnosing fetal alcohol syndrome requires expertise and a thorough assessment. Early diagnosis and services can help improve your child\'s ability to function. To make a diagnosis, your doctor: Discusses drinking during pregnancy. If you report the timing and amount of alcohol consumption, your obstetrician or other health care provider can help determine the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome. Although doctors can\'t diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome before a baby is born, they can assess the health of the mother and baby during pregnancy. Watches for signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome in your child\'s initial weeks, months and years of life. This includes assessing physical appearance and distinguishing features of your baby and monitoring your child\'s physical and brain growth and development.');

Reduced blood flow from narrowed arteries to the organs can affect the function of the organs. Fibromuscular dysplasia appears most commonly in the arteries leading to the kidneys. Fibromuscular dysplasia can also affect the arteries leading to your brain, heart, abdomen, arms and legs. Fibromuscular dysplasia can cause a number of complications, such as high blood pressure or tears of the artery (arterial dissection), if left untreated. Arterial dissection, or spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), can limit blood flow to the organ supplied by the injured artery.', 'Fibromuscular dysplasia can cause a number of complications. These include:\r\nHigh blood pressure. A common complication of fibromuscular dysplasia is high blood pressure. The narrowing of the arteries causes higher pressure on your artery walls, which can lead to further artery damage, heart disease or heart failure.\r\nDissected artery. Fibromuscular dysplasia can cause tears in the walls of your arteries, causing blood to leak into the artery wall. This process, called arterial dissection or spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), can limit blood flow to the organ supplied by the injured artery.\r\nAneurysms. Fibromuscular dysplasia can weaken the walls of your arteries, creating a bulge called an aneurysm. If an aneurysm ruptures, it can be a life-threatening emergency. An aneurysm can occur in any artery affected by fibromuscular dysplasia.', 'Some people who have fibromuscular dysplasia don\'t have any symptoms.

Tests may include: Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern. Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.

Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. Exposed skin in cold, windy weather is most vulnerable to frostbite. But frostbite can occur on skin covered by gloves or other clothing. Frost nip, the first stage of frostbite, doesn\'t cause permanent skin damage. You can treat very mild frostbite with first-aid measures, including rewarming your skin. All other frostbite requires medical attention because it can damage skin, tissues, muscle and bones. Possible complications of severe frostbite include infection and nerve damage', 'Frostbite occurs in several stages:\r\nFrostnip. The first stage of frostbite is frostnip. With this mild form of frostbite, your skin pales or turns red and feels very cold. Continued exposure leads to prickling and numbness in the affected area. As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling. Frostnip doesn\'t permanently damage the skin.\r\nSuperficial frostbite. The second stage of frostbite appears as reddened skin that turns white or pale. The skin may remain soft, but some ice crystals may form in the tissue. Your skin may begin to feel warm â€” a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of your skin may appear mottled, blue or purple. And you may notice stinging, burning and swelling. A fluid-filled blister may appear 24 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin.\r\nSevere (deep) frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin, including the tissues that lie below. You may experience numbness, losing all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the affected area. Joints or muscles may no longer work. Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Afterward, the area turns black and hard as the tissue dies.', 'Signs and symptoms of frostbite include: At first, cold skin and a prickling feeling ,Numbness ,Red, white, bluish-white or grayish-yellow skin , Hard or waxy-looking skin , Clumsiness due to joint and muscle stiffness , Blistering after rewarming, in severe cases , Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. Because of skin numbness, you may not realize you have frostbite until someone else points it out.', 'The diagnosis of frostbite is usually made based on your signs and symptoms, the appearance of your skin, and a review of recent activities in which you were exposed to cold. Your doctor may conduct tests, such as an X-ray, bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test, to determine the severity of the frostbite and to check if bone or muscle is damaged. Your doctor may also run tests if he or she suspects you have hypothermia, a condition that often occurs with frostbite.

Your chances of developing gangrene are higher if you have an underlying condition that can damage your blood vessels and affect blood flow, such as diabetes or hardened arteries (atherosclerosis).\r\nTreatments for gangrene include surgery to remove dead tissue, antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The prognosis for recovery is better if gangrene is identified early and treated quickly.', 'Gangrene may occur due to one or some of the following causes: Lack of blood supply. Your blood provides oxygen, nutrients to feed your cells, and immune system components, such as antibodies, to ward off infections. Without a proper blood supply, cells can\'t survive, and your tissue decays.\r\nInfection. If bacteria thrive unchecked for long, infection can take over and cause your tissue to die, causing gangrene.\r\nTrauma. Wounds that are traumatic, such as gunshot wounds or crushing injuries from car crashes, can cause bacteria to invade tissues deep within the body. When such tissues are infected, gangrene can occur.', 'When gangrene affects your skin, signs and symptoms may include: Skin discoloration â€” ranging from pale to blue, purple, black, bronze or red, depending on the type of gangrene you have , Swelling or the formation of blisters filled with fluid on the skin , A clear line between healthy and damaged skin , Sudden, severe pain followed by a feeling of numbness , A foul-smelling discharge leaking from a sore , Thin, shiny skin, or skin without hair , Skin that feels cool or cold to the touch.', 'Tests used to help make a diagnosis of gangrene include: Blood tests. An abnormally elevated white blood cell count often indicates the presence of an infection. Your doctor might also perform blood tests to look for the presence of certain bacteria or other germs.\r\nImaging tests. An X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can be used to view interior body structures, such as your internal organs, blood vessels or bones, and assess the extent to which gangrene has spread. These types of tests can also help your doctor see any gas that is present under your skin. An arteriogram is an imaging test used to visualize your arteries. During this test, dye is injected into your bloodstream and X-ray pictures are taken to determine how well blood is flowing through your arteries. An arteriogram can help your doctor find out whether any of your arteries are blocked. Surgery. Surgery may be performed to determine the extent to which gangrene has spread within your body.

Regular use of certain pain relievers and drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis. Gastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis), or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis). In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer. For most people, however, gastritis isn\'t serious and improves quickly with treatment.', 'Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining. Weaknesses or injury to the mucus-lined barrier that protects your stomach wall allows your digestive juices to damage and inflame your stomach lining. A number of diseases and conditions can increase your risk of gastritis, including Crohn\'s disease and sarcoidosis, a condition in which collections of inflammatory cells grow in the body.', 'The signs and symptoms of gastritis include:\r\nGnawing or burning ache or pain (indigestion) in your upper abdomen that may become either worse or better with eating\r\nNausea\r\nVomiting\r\nA feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating\r\nGastritis doesn\'t always cause signs and symptoms.', 'Although your doctor is likely to suspect gastritis after talking to you about your medical history and performing an exam, you may also have one or more of the following tests to pinpoint the exact cause. Tests for H. pylori. Your doctor may recommend tests to determine whether you have the bacterium H. pylori. Which type of test you undergo depends on your situation. H. pylori may be detected in a blood test, in a stool test or by a breath test. For the breath test, you drink a small glass of clear, tasteless liquid that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori bacteria break down the test liquid in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed.

(41, 'Glaucoma', 'upload/diseases/32.jpg', 'Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is vital to good vision. This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults. The most common form of glaucoma has no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is at an advanced stage. Vision loss due to glaucoma can\'t be recovered. So it\'s important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. If you have the condition, you\'ll generally need treatment for the rest of your life.', 'Glaucoma is the result of damage to the optic nerve. As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your visual field. For reasons that doctors don\'t fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye. Elevated eye pressure is due to a buildup of a fluid (aqueous humor) that flows throughout your eye. This fluid normally drains into the front of the eye (anterior chamber) through tissue (trabecular mesh work) at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. When fluid is overproduced or the drainage system doesn\'t work properly, the fluid can\'t flow out at its normal rate and pressure builds up. Glaucoma tends to run in families. In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage.', 'The signs and symptoms of glaucoma vary depending on the type and stage of your condition. For example: Open-angle glaucoma ,Patchy blind spots in your side (peripheral) or central vision, frequently in both eyes , Tunnel vision in the advanced stages , Acute angle-closure glaucoma , Severe headache , Eye pain, Nausea and vomiting, Blurred vision, Halos around lights, Eye redness.', 'The damage caused by glaucoma can\'t be reversed. But treatment and regular checkups can help slow or prevent vision loss, especially in you catch the disease in its early stage. The goal of glaucoma treatment is to lower pressure in your eye (intraocular pressure). Depending on your situation, your options may include eye drops, laser treatment or surgery. Glaucoma treatment often starts with prescription eye drops. These can help decrease eye pressure by improving how fluid drains from your eye or by decreasing the amount of fluid your eye makes. Prescription eyedrop medications include:\r\nProstaglandins. These increase the outflow of the fluid in your eye (aqueous humor) and reduce pressure in your eye. Examples include latanoprost (Xalatan) and bimatoprost (Lumigan). Possible side effects include mild reddening and stinging of the eyes, darkening of the iris, changes in the pigment of the eyelashes or eyelid skin, and blurred vision.\r\nBeta blockers. These reduce the production of fluid in your eye, thereby lowering the pressure in your eye (intraocular pressure). Examples include timolol (Betimol, Timoptic) and betaxolol (Betoptic). Possible side effects include difficulty breathing, slowed heart rate, lower blood pressure, impotence and fatigue.'),

This can stretch or tear the ligaments that hold your ankle bones and joints together.\r\n\r\nAll ligaments have a specific range of motion and boundaries that allow them to keep the joints stabilized. When ligaments surrounding the ankle are pushed past these boundaries, it causes a sprain. Sprained ankles most commonly involve injuries to the ligaments on the outside of the ankle.\r\n\r\nYou should call your doctor right away if you sprain your ankle. Your doctor can determine the severity of the injury and recommend a proper course of treatment. It can take several weeks or months for a sprained ankle to heal completely.', ' An ankle sprain often occurs when the foot suddenly twists or rolls, forcing the ankle joint out of its normal position. During physical activity, the ankle may twist inward as a result of sudden or unexpected movement. This causes one or more ligaments around the ankle to stretch or tear.\r\n\r\nSome swelling or bruising can occur as a result of these tears. You may also feel pain or discomfort when you place weight on the affected area. Tendons, cartilage, and blood vessels might also be damaged due to the sprain.\r\n\r\nAnkle sprains can happen to anyone at any age. Participating in sports, walking on uneven surfaces, or even wearing inappropriate footwear can all cause this type of injury.', ' <p>You may have a sprained ankle if you notice the following symptoms in the ankle:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>swelling</li>\r\n	<li>tenderness</li>\r\n	<li>bruising</li>\r\n	<li>pain</li>\r\n	<li>inability to put weight on the affected ankle</li>\r\n	<li>skin decoloration</li>\r\n	<li>stiffness</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', ' Your doctor will perform a physical exam to determine which ligaments have been torn. During the exam, your doctor may move your ankle joint in various ways to check your range of motion.\r\n\r\nImaging tests, such as X-rays, may also be ordered to rule out a bone fracture. An MRI may be done if your doctor suspects a fracture, a serious injury to the ligaments, or damage to the surface of the ankle joint.

(2, 'Abdominal Hysterectomy ', 'An abdominal hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that removes your uterus through an incision in your lower abdomen. Your uterus â€” or womb â€” is where a baby grows if you\'re pregnant.  A partial hysterectomy removes just the uterus, leaving the cervix intact. A total hysterectomy removes the uterus and the cervix. Sometimes a hysterectomy includes removal of one or both ovaries and Fallopian tubes, a procedure called a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy (sal-ping-go-o-of-uh-REK-tuh-me). A hysterectomy can also be performed through an incision in the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy) or by a laparoscopic or robotic surgical approach â€” which uses long, thin instruments passed through small abdominal incisions.', 'You may need a hysterectomy to treat:\r\nGynecologic cancer. If you have a gynecologic cancer â€” such as cancer of the uterus or cervix â€” a hysterectomy may be your best treatment option. Depending on the specific cancer you have and how advanced it is, your other options might include radiation or chemotherapy. Fibroids. A hysterectomy is the only certain, permanent solution for fibroids â€” benign uterine tumors that often cause persistent bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain or bladder pressure. Nonsurgical treatments of fibroids are a possibility, depending on your discomfort level and tumor size. Many women with fibroids have minimal symptoms and require no treatment.\r\n'),
(3, 'Ablation Therapy', 'Ablation therapy is a type of minimally invasive procedure doctors use to destroy abnormal tissue that occurs with many conditions. For example, a doctor might use an ablation procedure to treat a small kidney tumor or to destroy (ablate) a small amount of heart tissue that\'s causing abnormal heart rhythms. Doctors trained in imaging (radiologists), heart specialists (cardiologists) and other specialists perform ablation therapy. They may use probes inserted through the skin, flexible tubes (catheters) inserted through an artery or energy beams. Mapping and imaging techniques are used to guide the ablation. The abnormal tissue is injured or destroyed with heat (radio frequency ablation), extreme cold (cryoablation), lasers or a chemical.', 'Ablation therapy for some heart problems is used to reduce signs and symptoms and improve quality of life. Other types of ablation therapy are used instead of open surgery in order to spare healthy tissue and lower the risks of surgery. You may have a shorter hospital stay and a faster recovery after ablation therapy compared with open surgery. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of ablation therapy and whether it\'s an appropriate treatment option for you.'),
(4, 'ACL Reconstruction', 'ACL reconstruction is surgery to replace a torn anterior cruciate (KROO-she-ate) ligament (ACL) â€” one of the major ligaments in your knee. ACL injuries most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction â€” such as basketball, soccer, football, tennis, downhill skiing, volleyball and gymnastics. In an ACL reconstruction, the torn ligament is removed and replaced with a piece of tendon from another part of your knee or from a deceased donor. This surgery is an outpatient procedure that\'s performed through small incisions around your knee joint.', 'Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect one bone to another. The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia) and helps stabilize your knee joint.Most ACL injuries happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee: Suddenly slowing down and changing direction (cutting), pivoting with your foot firmly planted, landing from a jump incorrectly.'),
(5, 'Acupuncture', 'Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. A key component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is most commonly used to treat pain. Increasingly, it is being used for overall wellness, including stress management. Traditional Chinese medicine explains acupuncture as a technique for balancing the flow of energy or life force â€” known as chi or qi (chee) â€” believed to flow through pathways (meridians) in your body. By inserting needles into specific points along these meridians, acupuncture practitioners believe that your energy flow will re-balance.', 'Acupuncture is used mainly to relieve discomfort associated with a variety of diseases and conditions, including:Chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting , dental pain , headaches, including tension headaches and migraines , labor pain , low back pain , neck pain, osteoarthritis ,menstrual cramps ,respiratory disorders, such as allergic rhinitis.'),
(6, 'Annuloplasty', 'An annuloplasty is a procedure to tighten or reinforce the ring around a valve in the heart. This may be performed during other procedures to repair a heart valve.', 'The ring around a valve in the heart (annulus) can widen and change from its normal shape. This may occur when the heart is enlarged or when blood is leaking backward through the valve. The widening of the ring can cause the valve flaps (leaflets) attached to the ring not to open and close properly, which can cause blood to leak backward through the valve.\r\nIn some people, calcium deposits can build up on the ring, which can cause the valve flaps not to work properly and lead to blood leaking backward. To repair these issues, an annuloplasty or other valve repair procedures may be performed. An annuloplasty may be done to reshape, reinforce or tighten the ring around a heart valve (annulus).'),
(7, 'Bilirubin Test', 'Bilirubin testing checks for levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin (bil-ih-ROO-bin) is an orange-yellow substance made during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin passes through the liver and is eventually excreted out of the body.\r\nHigher than normal levels of bilirubin may indicate different types of liver problems. Occasionally, higher bilirubin levels may indicate an increased rate of destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).', 'Bilirubin testing is usually done as part of a group of tests to check the health of your liver. Bilirubin testing may be done to:\r\n1.Investigate jaundice â€” elevated levels of bilirubin can cause yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice). A common use of the test is to measure bilirubin levels in newborns. 2.Determine whether there might be blockage in your liver\'s bile ducts. 3.Help detect or monitor the progression of other liver disease, such as hepatitis.4.Help detect increased destruction of red blood cells. 5.Help follow how a treatment is working. 6.Help evaluate suspected drug toxicity'),
(8, 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow aspiration are procedures to collect and examine bone marrow â€” the spongy tissue inside some of your larger bones.\r\n\r\nBone marrow biopsy and aspiration can show whether your bone marrow is healthy and making normal amounts of blood cells. Doctors use these procedures to diagnose and monitor blood and marrow diseases, including some cancers, as well as fevers of unknown origin. Bone marrow has a fluid portion and a more solid portion. In bone marrow biopsy, your doctor uses a needle to withdraw a sample of the solid portion. In bone marrow aspiration, a needle is used to withdraw a sample of the fluid portion. Bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow aspiration are often done at the same time. Together, these procedures may be called a bone marrow exam.', 'Bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow aspiration offer detailed information about the condition of your bone marrow and blood cells. Your doctor may order a bone marrow exam if blood tests are abnormal or don\'t provide enough information about a suspected problem. Your doctor may perform a bone marrow exam to: diagnose a disease or condition involving the bone marrow or blood cells, determine the stage or progression of a disease, check iron levels and metabolism, monitor treatment of a disease, investigate a fever of unknown origin.'),
(9, 'Bone marrow transplant', 'A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that infuses healthy blood stem cells into your body to replace your damaged or diseased bone marrow. A bone marrow transplant is also called a stem cell transplant. A bone marrow transplant may be necessary if your bone marrow stops working and doesn\'t produce enough healthy blood cells. Bone marrow transplants may use cells from your own body (autologous transplant) or from a donor (allogeneic transplant).', 'A bone marrow transplant may be used to: safely allow treatment of your condition with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation by replacing or rescuing bone marrow damaged by treatment , replace diseased or damaged marrow with new stem cells , provide new stem cells, which can help kill cancer cells directly.'),
(10, 'Botox injections', 'Botox injections are the best known of a group of medications that use various forms of botulinum toxin to temporarily paralyze muscle activity. This toxin is produced by the microbe that causes botulism, a type of food poisoning.  Botox injections are noted primarily for the ability to reduce the appearance of some facial wrinkles. They are also used to treat such problems as repetitive neck spasms (cervical dystonia), excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), overactive bladder and lazy eye. Botox injections may also help prevent chronic migraines in some people. Botox was the first drug to use botulinum toxin. Other products now include Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin. Each is a little different, particularly when it comes to dosage units, so they aren\'t interchangeable.', 'Botulinum toxin injections block certain chemical signals from nerves, mostly signals that cause muscles to contract. The most common use of these injections is to temporarily relax the facial muscles that underlie and cause wrinkles, such as:\r\nfrown lines between the eyebrows , Crow\'s-feet, the lines that fan out from the corners of the eyes , Forehead furrows.'),
(11, 'Brain rehabilitation', 'Brain rehabilitation therapy helps people relearn functions lost as a result of a brain injury. These might include daily activities such as eating, dressing, walking or speech. Brain injuries can affect people in many different ways. People who experience serious brain injuries may have: Movement problems , Emotional problems , Thinking and memory problems , Language problems , Pain or numbness.', 'It can be challenging to return to independent living, work or school after a brain injury. Mayo Clinic\'s brain rehabilitation team works to help people with brain injuries regain as much function â€” and help them become as independent â€” as possible. A stroke is the most common cause of brain injury that requires brain rehabilitation. A stroke occurs when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain or bleeding in the brain. Many people treated in Mayo\'s Brain Rehabilitation Clinic have had strokes. Other common causes of brain dysfunction include brain tumors and traumatic brain injuries, which are caused by external forces â€” such as a fall or car accident â€” against your head or body.'),
(12, 'Cancer treatment', 'Cancer treatment is the use of surgery, radiation, medications and other therapies to cure a cancer, shrink a cancer or stop the progression of a cancer. Many cancer treatments exist. Depending on your particular situation, you may receive one treatment or you may receive a combination of treatments.', 'The goal of cancer treatment is to achieve a cure for your cancer, allowing you to live a normal life span. This may or may not be possible, depending on your specific situation. If a cure isn\'t possible, your treatments may be used to shrink your cancer or slow the growth of your cancer to allow you to live symptom free for as long as possible. Cancer treatments may be used as:\r\n1. Primary treatment. The goal of a primary treatment is to completely remove the cancer from your body or kill all the cancer cells. Any cancer treatment can be used as a primary treatment, but the most common primary cancer treatment for the most common types of cancer is surgery. If your cancer is particularly sensitive to radiation therapy or chemotherapy, you may receive one of those therapies as your primary treatment. 2. Adjuvant treatment. The goal of adjuvant therapy is to kill any cancer cells that may remain after primary treatment in order to reduce the chance that the cancer will recur.\r\nAny cancer treatment can be used as an adjuvant therapy. Common adjuvant therapies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy.'),
(13, 'Capsule endoscopy ', 'Capsule endoscopy is a procedure that uses a tiny wireless camera to take pictures of your digestive tract. A capsule endoscopy camera sits inside a vitamin-size capsule you swallow. As the capsule travels through your digestive tract, the camera takes thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder you wear on a belt around your waist.\r\nCapsule endoscopy helps doctors see inside your small intestine â€” an area that isn\'t easily reached with more-traditional endoscopy procedures. Traditional endoscopy involves passing a long, flexible tube equipped with a video camera down your throat or through your rectum.', 'Your doctor might recommend a capsule endoscopy procedure to:\r\n1. Find the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. If you have unexplained bleeding in your digestive tract, capsule endoscopy can help find the cause. 2. Diagnose inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn\'s disease. Capsule endoscopy can reveal areas of \r\n inflammation in the small intestine. 3.Diagnose cancer. Capsule endoscopy can show tumors in the small intestine or other parts of the digestive tract. 4.Diagnose celiac disease. Capsule endoscopy is sometimes used in diagnosing and monitoring this immune reaction to eating gluten.'),
(14, 'Cataract surgery', 'Cataract surgery is a procedure to remove the lens of your eye and, in most cases, replace it with an artificial lens. Normally, the lens of your eye is clear. A cataract causes the lens to become cloudy, which eventually affects your vision. Cataract surgery is performed by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) on an outpatient basis, which means you don\'t have to stay in the hospital after the surgery. Cataract surgery can be done traditionally using ultrasound energy to remove the cloudy lens or it can be removed with laser-assisted technology. Cataract surgery is very common and is generally a safe procedure.', 'Cataract surgery is performed to treat cataracts. Cataracts can cause blurry vision and increase the glare from lights. If a cataract makes it difficult for you to carry out your normal activities, your doctor may suggest cataract surgery. When a cataract interferes with the treatment of another eye problem, cataract surgery may be recommended. For example, doctors may recommend cataract surgery if a cataract makes it difficult for your eye doctor to examine the back of your eye to monitor or treat other eye problems such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.'),
(15, 'Chemotherapy', 'Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in your body. Chemotherapy is most often used to treat cancer, since cancer cells grow and multiply much more quickly than most cells in the body. Many different chemotherapy drugs are available. Chemotherapy drugs can be used alone or in combination to treat a wide variety of cancers. Though chemotherapy is an effective way to treat many types of cancer, chemotherapy treatment also carries a risk of side effects. Some chemotherapy side effects are mild and treatable, while others can cause serious complications.', 'Chemotherapy is used to kill cancer cells in people with cancer. There are a variety of settings in which chemotherapy may be used in people with cancer: To cure the cancer without other treatments. Chemotherapy can be used as the primary or sole treatment for cancer. After other treatments, to kill hidden cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be used after other treatments, such as surgery, to kill any cancer cells that might remain in the body. Doctors call this adjuvant therapy.\r\nTo prepare you for other treatments. Chemotherapy can be used to shrink a tumor so that other treatments, such as radiation and surgery, are possible. Doctors call this neoadjuvant therapy. To ease signs and symptoms. Chemotherapy may help relieve signs and symptoms of cancer by killing some of the cancer cells. Doctors call this palliative chemotherapy.'),
(16, 'Dilation and curettage', 'Dilation and curettage (D&C) is a procedure to remove tissue from inside your uterus. Doctors perform dilation and curettage to diagnose and treat certain uterine conditions â€” such as heavy bleeding â€” or to clear the uterine lining after a miscarriage or abortion. In a dilation and curettage â€” sometimes spelled \"dilatation\" and curettage â€” your doctor uses small instruments or a medication to open (dilate) your cervix â€” the lower, narrow part of your uterus. Your doctor then uses a surgical instrument called a curette to remove uterine tissue. Curettes used in a D&C can be sharp or use suction.', 'Dilation and curettage can diagnose or treat a uterine condition.\r\nTo diagnose a condition :  Your doctor might recommend a type of D&C called endometrial sampling to diagnose a condition if: You have abnormal uterine bleeding , You experience bleeding after menopause , Your doctor discovers abnormal endometrial cells during a routine test for cervical cancer.'),
(17, ' Discogram', 'A discogram, also spelled diskogram, is a test used to evaluate back pain. A discogram might help your doctor determine if an abnormal disk in your spine is causing your back pain. Spinal disks are sponge like cushions between the bones (vertebrae) of the spine. During a discogram, dye is injected into the soft center of one or more disks. The injection sometimes reproduces your back pain. The dye also moves into any cracks in the disk\'s exterior, which can then be seen on an X-ray or CT scan. However, disks that show signs of wear and tear don\'t always cause symptoms, so the usefulness of a discogram is controversial.', 'A discogram is an invasive test that generally isn\'t used for an initial evaluation of back pain. Your doctor might suggest a discogram if your back pain persists despite conservative treatments, such as medication and physical therapy.\r\nSome doctors use a discogram before spinal fusion surgery to help identify which disks need to be removed. However, discograms are not always accurate in pinpointing which disks, if any, are causing back pain. Many doctors instead rely on other tests, such as MRI and CT scanning, to diagnose disk problems and guide treatment.'),
(18, 'Diskectomy ', 'Diskectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the damaged portion of a herniated disk in your spine. A herniated disk can irritate or compress nearby nerves and cause pain, numbness or weakness. These symptoms can affect your neck or back or may radiate down your arms or legs. Diskectomy works best on radiating symptoms. It\'s less helpful for actual back pain or neck pain. Most people who have back pain or neck pain find relief with more-conservative treatments, such as pain medications or physical therapy. Your doctor may suggest diskectomy if conservative, nonsurgical treatments haven\'t worked or if your symptoms worsen. There are several ways to perform a diskectomy. Many surgeons now prefer minimally invasive diskectomy, which uses small incisions and a tiny video camera for viewing', 'A diskectomy is performed to relieve the pressure a herniated disk (also called slipped, ruptured or bulging disk or disk prolapse) places on a spinal nerve. A herniated disk occurs when some of the softer material inside the disk pushes out through a crack in the tougher exterior. Your doctor may recommend diskectomy if: You have trouble standing or walking because of nerve weakness , Conservative treatment, such as medication or physical therapy, fails to improve your symptoms after six weeks.'),
(19, 'Donor nephrectomy', 'A donor nephrectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a healthy kidney from a live donor for transplant into a person whose kidneys no longer function properly. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on each side of the spine just below the rib cage. Each one is about the size of a fist. Their main function is to filter and remove excess waste, minerals and fluid from the blood by producing urine. You can donate one of your two kidneys, and the remaining kidney is able to perform the necessary functions, which makes living-donor kidney transplant an alternative to deceased-donor kidney transplant.\r\n\r\nPeople with end-stage kidney (renal) disease need to have waste removed from their bloodstream via a machine (dialysis) or a kidney transplant to stay alive.', 'Live kidney donation via a donor nephrectomy offers an alternative to waiting for a deceased-donor organ to become available for people in need of a kidney transplant. A kidney transplant is usually the treatment of choice for kidney failure compared with a lifetime on dialysis. The use of donor nephrectomy for live kidney donation has increased in recent years as the number of people waiting for a kidney transplant has increased dramatically. The demand for donor kidneys far outweighs the supply of deceased-donor kidneys, which makes living-donor kidney transplant an attractive option for people waiting for a deceased-donor kidney to become available. In addition, living-donor kidney transplants are associated with several benefits for the recipient, including fewer complications and longer survival of the donor organ than in deceased-donor transplants.'),
(20, 'Endometrial ablation', 'Endometrial ablation is a procedure that surgically destroys (ablates) the lining of your uterus (endometrium). The goal of endometrial ablation is to reduce menstrual flow. In some women, menstrual flow may stop completely. No incisions are needed for endometrial ablation. Your doctor inserts slender tools through the passageway between your vagina and uterus (cervix). The tools vary, depending on the method used to ablate the endometrium. They might include extreme cold, heated fluids, microwave energy or high-energy radio frequencies. Some types of endometrial ablation can be done in your doctor\'s office. Others must be performed in an operating room. Factors such as the size and condition of your uterus will help determine which endometrial ablation method is most appropriate.\r\n', 'Endometrial ablation is a treatment for excessive menstrual blood loss. Your doctor might recommend endometrial ablation if you have: Unusually heavy periods, sometimes defined as soaking a pad or tampon every two hours or less , Bleeding that lasts longer than eight days , Anemia from excessive blood loss.'),
(21, 'Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty', 'Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is a newer type of weight-loss procedure. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty reduces the size of your stomach using an endoscopic suturing device without the need for surgery. This procedure may be an option if you\'re significantly overweight â€” a body mass index of 30 or more â€” and diet and exercise haven\'t worked for you.\r\nEndoscopic sleeve gastroplasty leads to significant weight loss. It helps you lose weight by limiting how much you can eat. And the procedure is minimally invasive, reducing the risk of operative complications. Like other weight-loss procedures, endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty requires commitment to a healthier lifestyle. You need to make permanent healthy changes to your diet and get regular exercise to help ensure the long-term success of endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty.', 'Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed to help you lose weight and potentially lower your risk of serious weight-related health problems, including: Gastroesophageal reflux disease , Heart disease and stroke , High blood pressure ,Sleep apnea ,Type 2 diabetes.  Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty and other weight-loss procedures or surgeries are typically done only after you\'ve tried to lose weight by improving your diet and exercise habits. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is less invasive and cheaper than other forms of bariatric surgery.'),
(22, 'Esophageal manometry', 'Esophageal manometry (muh-NOM-uh-tree) is a test that shows whether your esophagus is working properly. The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Esophageal manometry measures the rhythmic muscle contractions that occur in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus. During esophageal manometry, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that contains sensors is passed through your nose, down your esophagus and into your stomach. Esophageal manometry can be helpful in diagnosing certain disorders that may affect your esophagus.', 'Esophageal manometry provides information about the movement (motility) of food through the esophagus and into the stomach. The test measures how well the circular bands of muscle (sphincters) at the top and bottom of your esophagus open and close, as well as the pressure, strength and pattern of the wave of esophageal muscle contractions that moves food along. If your main symptom is difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or pain when swallowing (odynophagia), your doctor is likely to order other tests, such as x-rays, before or instead of esophageal manometry. These tests identify or rule out an obstruction in the esophagus â€” a narrowing, a complete blockage or an area of inflammation. Swallowing problems generally point more strongly to an obstruction than to a motility disorder.'),
(23, 'Essure ', 'The Essure system is a type of permanent birth control for women. It cannot be reversed. This type of female sterilization involves placing small metal and fiber coils in the fallopian tubes, which creates scar tissue that prevents sperm from reaching an egg. During the procedure, the doctor inserts a flexible tube with a small camera (hysteroscope) through the vagina and cervix and up to the uterus. From here, the doctor can see the opening to the fallopian tubes and place the Essure system coils into them. It takes about three months for the Essure system to prevent pregnancy. In some women, it may take up to six months. During this time, you must use another form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Essure doesn\'t protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).', 'The Essure system is a type of female sterilization. It\'s a permanent way to prevent pregnancy. Benefits of using the Essure system include: It works very well. The risk of pregnancy is about 0.1 percent when the coils are placed properly.\r\nThe procedure can be done in the doctor\'s office. Little or no anesthesia is needed. You can return to daily activities the day of the procedure. There\'s no incision or scarring of the skin. After your doctor confirms the system is working and your tubes are blocked, you\'ll no longer need to buy contraception, other than products used to prevent STIs. Most women report no long-term side effects.'),
(24, 'Face transplant', 'Face transplant is a treatment option for some people with severe facial disfigurement. A face transplant replaces all or part of a person\'s face with donor tissue from someone who has died. Face transplant is a complex operation that takes months of planning and multiple surgical teams. The procedure is performed in only a few transplant centers worldwide. Each face transplant candidate is carefully evaluated to help ensure the best possible results in appearance and function. A face transplant may enhance your life, but it is a high-risk procedure. You and your transplant team can\'t predict exactly how you will look and how your immune system will respond to the new face. You will need to take special medications (immunosuppressants) for the rest of your life to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the transplanted face.', 'A face transplant is performed to try to improve the quality of life for a person badly disfigured by facial trauma, burns, disease or birth defects. It is intended to enhance both appearance and functional abilities, such as chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing through the nose. Some people seek this surgery to reduce the social isolation they experience while living with severe facial disfigurement.'),
(25, 'Fetal fibronectin', 'Fetal fibronectin is a protein that\'s believed to help keep the amniotic sac \"glued\" to the lining of the uterus. The amniotic sac is the fluid-filled membrane that cushions your baby in the uterus. Fetal fibronectin is often present in vaginal discharge before week 22 of pregnancy. Fetal fibronectin also begins to break down and can be detected in vaginal discharge toward the end of pregnancy. If your health care provider is concerned about preterm labor, he or she might test a swab of secretions near your cervix for the presence of fetal fibronectin between week 22 and week 34 of pregnancy. A positive fetal fibronectin test is a clue that the \"glue\" has been disturbed and you\'re at increased risk of preterm labor.', 'The fetal fibronectin test is used to rule out preterm labor. It\'s generally not useful for women who are at low risk of preterm labor, but it can provide valuable information for women who have signs or symptoms of preterm labor or those who are at high risk of preterm labor. If the fetal fibronectin test is positive, your health care provider will take steps to address premature birth â€” such as administering medication to enhance the baby\'s lung maturity. If the fetal fibronectin test is negative, you can be assured that you\'re unlikely to deliver within the next two weeks.'),
(26, 'Fetal ultrasound', 'A fetal ultrasound, or sonogram, is an imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of a baby in the uterus. Fetal ultrasound images can help your health care provider evaluate your baby\'s growth and development and determine how your pregnancy is progressing. In some cases, fetal ultrasound is used to evaluate possible problems or help confirm a diagnosis. The first fetal ultrasound is usually done during the first trimester to confirm and date the pregnancy. If your pregnancy remains uncomplicated, the next ultrasound is typically offered during the second trimester, when anatomic details are visible. If your baby\'s health needs to be monitored more closely, additional ultrasounds might be recommended.', 'First trimester ultrasound examination is done to evaluate the presence, size, number and location of the pregnancy. Ultrasound can also be used for first-trimester sonographic genetic screening, as well as screening for any abnormalities of your uterus or cervix. In the second or third trimester a standard ultrasound is done to evaluate several features of the pregnancy, including fetal anatomy. This exam is typically done between weeks 18 and 20 of pregnancy. However, the timing of this ultrasound might be altered for reasons such as obesity or prior surgical incision at the scanning site, which could limit visualization of the fetus. During the second and third trimesters, limited ultrasound evaluation might be needed when a specific question requires investigation. Examples include the evaluation of fetal growth and the estimation of amniotic fluid volume. A specialized or detailed exam is done when an anomaly is suspected based on your history or other prenatal exam results.'),
(27, 'Forceps delivery ', 'A forceps delivery is a type of assisted vaginal delivery. It\'s sometimes needed in the course of vaginal childbirth.\r\nIn a forceps delivery, a health care provider applies forceps â€” an instrument shaped like a pair of large spoons or salad tongs â€” to the baby\'s head to help guide the baby out of the birth canal. This is typically done during a contraction while the mother pushes. Your health care provider might recommend a forceps delivery during the second stage of labor â€” when you\'re pushing â€” if labor isn\'t progressing or the baby\'s safety depends on an immediate delivery. A forceps delivery poses a risk of injury for both mother and baby. If a forceps delivery fails, a cesarean delivery (C-section) might be needed.', 'A forceps delivery might be considered if your labor meets certain criteria â€” your cervix is fully dilated, your membranes have ruptured and your baby has descended into the birth canal headfirst, but you\'re not able to push the baby out. A forceps delivery is only appropriate in a birthing center or hospital where a C-section can be done, if needed. Your health care provider might recommend a forceps delivery if: You\'re pushing, but labor isn\'t progressing. If you\'ve never given birth before, labor is considered stalled if you\'ve pushed for a period of two to three hours but haven\'t made any progress. If you\'ve given birth before, labor might be considered stalled if you\'ve pushed for a period of one to two hours without any progress. Your baby\'s heartbeat suggests a problem. If your health care provider is concerned about changes in your baby\'s heartbeat and an immediate delivery is necessary, he or she might recommend a forceps delivery. You have a health concern. If you have certain medical conditions â€” such as narrowing of the heart\'s aortic valve (aortic valve stenosis) â€” your health care provider might limit the amount of time you push Your baby is facing the wrong direction. A forceps delivery might be needed if your baby is facing up (occiput posterior position) rather than down (occiput anterior position).'),
(28, 'Gene therapy', 'Gene therapy involves altering the genes inside your body\'s cells in an effort to treat or stop disease. Genes contain your DNA â€” the code that controls much of your body\'s form and function, from making you grow taller to regulating your body systems. Genes that don\'t work properly can cause disease. Gene therapy replaces a faulty gene or adds a new gene in an attempt to cure disease or improve your body\'s ability to fight disease. Gene therapy holds promise for treating a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, hemophilia and AIDS.\r\nResearchers are still studying how and when to use gene therapy. Currently, in the United States, gene therapy is available only as part of a clinical trial.', 'Gene therapy is used to correct defective genes in order to cure a disease or help your body better fight disease. Researchers are investigating several ways to do this, including: Replacing mutated genes. Some cells become diseased because certain genes work incorrectly or no longer work at all. Replacing the defective genes may help treat certain diseases. For instance, a gene called p53 normally prevents tumor growth. Several types of cancer have been linked to problems with the p53 gene. If doctors could replace the defective p53 gene, that might trigger the cancer cells to die.\r\nFixing mutated genes. Mutated genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease, or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could inhibit the disease.\r\nMaking diseased cells more evident to the immune system. In some cases, your immune system doesn\'t attack diseased cells because it doesn\'t recognize them as intruders. Doctors could use gene therapy to train your immune system to recognize the cells that are a threat.'),
(29, 'Genetic testing', 'Genetic testing involves examining your DNA, the chemical database that carries instructions for your body\'s functions. Genetic testing can reveal changes (mutations) in your genes that may cause illness or disease. Although genetic testing can provide important information for diagnosing, treating and preventing illness, there are limitations. For example, if you\'re a healthy person, a positive result from genetic testing doesn\'t always mean you will develop a disease. On the other hand, in some situations, a negative result doesn\'t guarantee that you won\'t have a certain disorder. Talking to your doctor, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor about what you will do with the results is an important step in the process of genetic testing.', 'Genetic testing plays a vital role in determining the risk of developing certain diseases as well as screening and sometimes medical treatment. Different types of genetic testing are done for different reasons: Diagnostic testing:  If you have symptoms of a disease that may be caused by genetic changes, sometimes called mutated genes, genetic testing can reveal if you have the suspected disorder. For example, genetic testing may be used to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis or Huntington\'s disease. Presymptomatic and predictive testing: If you have a family history of a genetic condition, getting genetic testing before you have symptoms may show if you\'re at risk of developing that condition. For example, this type of test may be useful for identifying your risk of certain types of colorectal cancer. Carrier testing: If you have a family history of a genetic disorder â€” such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis â€” or you\'re in an ethnic group that has a high risk of a specific genetic disorder, you may choose to have genetic testing before having children. An expanded carrier screening test can detect genes associated with a wide variety of genetic diseases and mutations and can identify if you and your partner are carriers for the same conditions.'),

The glucose challenge test is done during pregnancy to screen for gestational diabetes â€” diabetes that develops during pregnancy. The glucose challenge test is done in two steps. First you drink a sugary solution. One hour later, your blood sugar level is measured. The results of the glucose challenge test indicate whether you might have gestational diabetes. If the test results are above normal, you\'ll need to have further testing to determine the diagnosis.', 'The glucose challenge test is used to screen for gestational diabetes. The test is generally done between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. However, it can be done as early as your first prenatal visit if you\'re at high risk of gestational diabetes due to obesity, a personal history of gestational diabetes, a family history of diabetes or other factors. Abnormal test results early in pregnancy might indicate that you have pre-existing type 2 diabetes that wasn\'t previously recognized, rather than gestational diabetes. Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, without careful management, gestational diabetes can lead to various pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia or excess fetal growth â€” which might increase the risk of birth injuries or prompt a C-section delivery.'),

(32, 'Heart valve surgery', 'Heart valve surgery is a procedure to treat heart valve disease. In heart valve disease, at least one of the four heart valves that keep blood flowing in the correct direction through your heart doesn\'t function properly. These valves include the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve. Each valve has flaps called leaflets, for the mitral and tricuspid valves, and cusps, for the aortic and pulmonary valves. These flaps open and close once during each heartbeat. Sometimes the valves don\'t open or close properly, disrupting the blood flow through your heart to your body. In heart valve surgery, your surgeon repairs or replaces the affected heart valves. Many surgical procedures may be used to repair or replace heart valves, including open-heart surgery or minimally invasive heart surgery. Your treatment depends on several factors, including your age, health, the condition of the heart valve that is affected and the severity of your condition.', 'Heart valve surgery may be needed if your condition is getting worse, your condition is severe or you\'re experiencing signs and symptoms of valve dysfunction. Your doctor may evaluate you to determine the most appropriate treatment for your condition. If you\'re not experiencing signs or symptoms, or your condition is mild, your doctor may suggest monitoring your condition over time. He or she may recommend healthy lifestyle changes. You may be prescribed medications to manage any symptoms . However, your valve may eventually need to be repaired or replaced. In some cases, doctors may recommend heart valve repair or replacement even if you\'re not experiencing symptoms. If you need heart surgery for another condition, doctors may conduct surgery to repair or replace the affected heart valve at the same time. Your doctor will discuss with you whether heart valve repair or replacement is most appropriate for your condition. Doctors often recommend heart valve repair when possible, as it preserves your heart valve and may preserve heart function. In some cases, you may need heart valve replacement. Doctors may also evaluate if you\'re a candidate for minimally invasive heart surgery. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each procedure.'),

(36, 'Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)', 'Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is a method of radiation therapy that incorporates imaging techniques during each treatment session. Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams of radiation to control cancer and noncancerous tumors. By adding detailed images, IGRT ensures the powerful radiation is narrowly focused at the treatment area. When undergoing IGRT, high-quality images are taken before each radiation therapy treatment session. IGRT may make it possible to use higher doses of radiation, which increases the probability of tumor control and typically results in shorter treatment schedules. IGRT is the standard of care for radiation therapy treatment. It\'s used to treat all types of cancer.', 'IGRT is used to treat all types of cancer, but it\'s particularly ideal for tumors and cancers located very close to sensitive structures and organs. IGRT is also useful for tumors that are likely to move during treatment or between treatments. IGRT is used as part of radiation treatment plans because it offers: Accurate delivery of radiation , Improved definition, localization and monitoring of tumor position, size and shape before and during treatment ,The possibility of higher, targeted radiation dosage to improve tumor control ,Decreased radiation exposure to normal tissue surrounding the tumor.'),

(39, 'Intrauterine insemination (IUI) ', 'Intrauterine insemination (IUI) â€” a type of artificial insemination â€” is a procedure for treating infertility. Sperm that have been washed and concentrated are placed directly in your uterus around the time your ovary releases one or more eggs to be fertilized. Older types of artificial insemination placed the sperm in the vagina. While this was easier, it was not as successful as the current procedure. The hoped-for outcome of intrauterine insemination is for the sperm to swim into the fallopian tube and fertilize a waiting egg, resulting in a normal pregnancy. Depending on the reasons for infertility, IUI can be coordinated with your normal cycle or with fertility medications.', 'A couple\'s ability to become pregnant depends on many different factors. Intrauterine insemination is used most often in couples who have: 1.Donor sperm. For women who need to use donor sperm to get pregnant, IUI is most commonly used to achieve pregnancy. Frozen donor sperm specimens are obtained from certified labs and thawed before the IUI procedure.\r\n2.Unexplained infertility. IUI is often performed as a first treatment for unexplained infertility along with ovulation-inducing medications. 3.Endometriosis-related infertility. For infertility related to endometriosis, using medications to obtain a good quality egg along with performing IUI is often the first treatment approach. 4.Mild male factor infertility (subfertility). Your partner\'s semen analysis, one of the first steps in the medical assessment of infertility, may show below-average sperm concentration, weak movement (motility) of sperm, or abnormalities in sperm size and shape (morphology). IUI can overcome some of these problems because preparing sperm for the procedure helps separate highly motile, normal sperm from those of lower quality.'),

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine just below the rib cage. Each one is about the size of a fist. Their main function is to filter and remove excess waste, minerals and fluid from the blood by producing urine. When your kidneys lose this filtering ability, harmful levels of fluid and waste accumulate in your body, which can raise your blood pressure and result in kidney failure (end-stage renal disease, which is also known as end-stage kidney disease). End-stage renal disease occurs when the kidneys have lost about 90 percent of their ability to function normally.', 'A kidney transplant is often the treatment of choice for kidney failure compared to a lifetime on dialysis. A kidney transplant can treat chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration rate (GFR, a measure of kidney function) less than or equal to 20 ml/min and end-stage renal disease to help you feel better and live longer.

When an oophorectomy involves removing both ovaries, it\'s called bilateral oophorectomy. When the surgery involves removing only one ovary, it\'s called unilateral oophorectomy.', 'An oophorectomy may be performed for: A tubo-ovarian abscess â€” a pus-filled pocket involving a fallopian tube and an ovary ,Ovarian cancer ,Endometriosis , Noncancerous (benign) ovarian tumors or cysts ,Reducing the risk of ovarian cancer or breast cancer in those at increased risk ,Ovarian torsion â€” the twisting of an ovary ,'),
(58, 'Oral cancer', 'Oral cancer screening is an examination performed by a dentist or doctor to look for signs of cancer or precancerous conditions in your mouth. The goal of oral cancer screening is to identify mouth cancer early, when there is a greater chance for a cure. Most dentists perform an examination of your mouth during a routine dental visit to screen for oral cancer. Some dentists may use additional tests to aid in identifying areas of abnormal cells in your mouth. Medical organizations disagree on whether healthy people without risk factors for mouth cancer need oral cancer screening. No single oral exam or oral cancer screening test is proved to reduce the risk of dying of oral cancer. Still, you and your dentist may decide that an oral exam or a special test is right for you based on your risk factors.', 'The goal of oral cancer screening is to detect mouth cancer or precancerous lesions that may lead to mouth cancer at an early stage â€” when cancer or lesions are easiest to remove and most likely to be cured. But no studies have proved that oral cancer screening saves lives, so not all organizations agree about the benefits of an oral exam for oral cancer screening. Some groups recommend screening, while others don\'t. People with a high risk of oral cancer may be more likely to benefit from oral cancer screening, though studies haven\'t clearly proved that. Factors that can increase the risk of oral cancer include: Tobacco use of any kind, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco and snuff, among others\r\nHeavy alcohol use ,Previous oral cancer diagnosis , History of significant sun exposure, which increases the risk of lip cancer .'),
(59, 'Otoplasty ', 'Otoplasty â€” also known as cosmetic ear surgery â€” is a procedure to change the shape, position or size of the ears. You might choose to have otoplasty if you\'re bothered by how far your ears stick out from your head. You might also consider otoplasty if your ear or ears are misshapen due to an injury or birth defect. Otoplasty can be done at any age after the ears have reached their full size â€” usually after age 5 â€” through adulthood. In some cases, the surgery is done as early as age 3. If a child is born with prominent ears and certain other ear-shape problems, splinting may successfully correct these issues if started immediately after birth.', 'You might consider otoplasty if: Your ear or ears stick out too far from your head ,Your ears are large in proportion to your head , You\'re dissatisfied with a previous ear surgery , Otoplasty is typically done on both ears to optimize symmetry.\r\nOtoplasty can be done at any age after the ears have reached their full size â€” usually after age 5. Otoplasty won\'t change the location of your ears or alter your ability to hear.'),
(60, 'Pacemaker', 'A pacemaker is a small device with two parts â€” a generator and wires (leads, or electrodes) â€” that\'s placed under the skin in your chest to help control your heartbeat. People may need a pacemaker for a variety of reasons â€” mostly due to one of a group of conditions called arrhythmias, in which the heart\'s rhythm is abnormal. Normal aging of the heart may disrupt your heart rate, making it beat too slowly. Heart muscle damage resulting from a heart attack is another common cause of disruptions of your heartbeat. Some medications can affect your heart rate as well. For some, genetic conditions cause an abnormal heart rate. Regardless of the underlying cause of an abnormal heart rate, a pacemaker may fix it. A pacemaker can often be implanted in your chest with a minor surgery. You may need to take some precautions in your daily life after your pacemaker is installed.', 'Pacemakers are implanted to help control your heartbeat. They can be implanted temporarily to treat a slow heartbeat after a heart attack, surgery or overdose of medication. Pacemakers can also be implanted permanently to correct a slow heartbeat (bradycardia) or, in some cases, to help treat heart failure. Smaller pacemakers about the size of a pill have been developed and are currently undergoing clinical trials. This new, leadless device can be implanted directly into the heart, where it emits an electrical impulse to control the heartbeat. Because a lead isn\'t required, this device can minimize the risk of infection and speed recovery time.'),
(61, 'Pelvic exam', 'During a pelvic exam, a doctor evaluates your reproductive organs. You might have a pelvic exam as part of your regular checkup. Or your doctor might recommend a pelvic exam if you have symptoms such as unusual vaginal discharge or pelvic pain. A pelvic exam usually lasts only a few minutes. Your doctor checks your vulva, vagina, cervix, ovaries, uterus, rectum and pelvis for any abnormalities. A Pap test, which screens for cervical cancer, is often performed during a pelvic exam.', 'You might need a pelvic exam: To assess your gynecological health. A pelvic exam often is part of a routine physical exam to find possible signs of ovarian cysts, sexually transmitted infections, uterine fibroids or early-stage cancer. Pelvic exams are also commonly performed during pregnancy. There is a lot of debate among experts regarding the recommended frequency of pelvic exams. Ask your doctor what he or she recommends. To diagnose a medical condition. Your doctor might suggest a pelvic exam if you\'re experiencing gynecological symptoms such as pelvic pain, unusual vaginal bleeding, skin changes, abnormal vaginal discharge or urinary problems. A pelvic exam can help your doctor diagnose the causes of these symptoms. Your doctor might suggest additional diagnostic testing or treatment.'),
(62, 'Penile implants', 'Penile implants are devices placed inside the penis to allow men with erectile dysfunction (ED) to get an erection. Penile implants are typically recommended after other treatments for ED fail. There are two main types of penile implants, semirigid and inflatable. Each type of penile implant works differently and has various pros and cons. The placement of penile implants requires surgery. Before choosing penile implants, make sure you understand what surgery involves, including possible risks, complications and follow-up care.', 'For most men, erectile dysfunction can be successfully treated with medications or use of a penis pump (vacuum constriction device). You might consider penile implants if you aren\'t a candidate for other treatments or you can\'t get an erection sufficient for sexual activity by using other methods. Penile implants can also be used to treat severe cases of a condition that causes scarring inside the penis, leading to curved, painful erections (Peyronie\'s disease). Penile implants aren\'t for everyone. Your doctor might caution against penile implants if you have:ED that\'s situational, the result of a relationship conflict or potentially reversible , An infection, such as a pulmonary infection or urinary tract infection\r\nDiabetes that isn\'t well-controlled.'),
(63, 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatectomy includes a number of surgical procedures to remove part or all of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is situated in the male pelvis, below the urinary bladder. It surrounds the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder to the penis. Prostatectomy can be performed in several ways, depending on the condition involved and recommended treatment approach. Prostate cancer\r\nRadical prostatectomy is surgery to remove the entire prostate gland and surrounding lymph nodes as treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. A surgeon can perform a radical prostatectomy using different techniques, including:\r\n1. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The surgeon makes several small incisions in your lower abdomen to remove the prostate. He or she sits at a console, using instruments attached to a computer-assisted mechanical device (robot). The robotic device allows a more precise response to movement of the surgeon\'s hands. 2. Open radical prostatectomy. The surgeon typically makes an incision in your lower abdomen to remove the prostate (retropubic surgery).', 'Most often, prostatectomy is done to treat localized prostate cancer. It may be used alone, or in conjunction with radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Prostatectomy to treat prostate cancer involves removing the entire prostate, seminal vesicles and some surrounding tissue, including lymph nodes. Prostatectomy options to treat prostate cancer include open radical prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Less often, simple prostatectomy may also be used to treat a blocked urethra caused by BPH. Simple prostatectomy to treat BPH doesn\'t always involve removing the entire prostate'),
(64, 'Quad screen', 'The quad screen â€” also known as the quadruple marker test, the second trimester screen or simply the quad test â€” is a prenatal test that measures levels of four substances in a pregnant woman\'s blood: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a protein made by the developing baby , Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a hormone made by the placenta ,Estriol, a hormone made by the placenta and the baby\'s liver , Inhibin A, another hormone made by the placenta . Ideally, the quad screen is done between weeks 15 and 18 of pregnancy â€” the second trimester. However, the procedure can be done up to week 20.\r\nThe quad screen is used to evaluate whether your pregnancy has an increased chance of being affected with certain chromosomal conditions, such as Down syndrome. The alpha-fetoprotein part of the test can help evaluate the chance for neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, and abdominal wall defects, such as omphalocele.', 'The quad screen is done to evaluate your chance of carrying a baby who has any of the following conditions:\r\nDown syndrome (trisomy 21): Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that causes lifelong intellectual disability and developmental delays and, in some people, health problems. Trisomy 18: This is a chromosomal disorder that causes severe developmental delays and anatomic abnormalities. Trisomy 18 is often fatal by age 1.\r\nSpina bifida: Spina bifida is a serious birth defect that occurs when a portion of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine.\r\nAnencephaly. Anencephaly is a serious birth defect in the closure of the neural tube, resulting in an underdeveloped brain and an incomplete skull.\r\nThe quad screen has traditionally been the most commonly used screening in the second trimester. It was generally used if prenatal care began during the second trimester or if first trimester screening, which involves a blood test and an ultrasound exam, wasn\'t available. Your health care provider might combine the results of first trimester screening with the quad screen to improve the detection rate of Down syndrome.');
